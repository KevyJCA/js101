            <p>I am currently using the "Head First JavaScript Programming - A Brain-Friendly Guide"
                as my learning resource and will make repositories for every chapter. I am also intending on completing The Odin Project as well as a few peronal
            ideas. Each repository will be marked accordingly going forward in reference to chapter, Odin module, or personal project. CSS and HTML will not be focused on for some of these modules. </p>
